<p>
  The <a href="https://www.telerik.com/aspnet-mvc/grid" target="_blank">Telerik UI for ASP.NET MVC Data Grid</a> provides the column-virtualization feature, which enables you to operate with a large number of columns where displaying them at once will not impose a performance penalty due to limited browser resources. 
</p>
<p>
  This demo shows how to implement the column-virtualization functionality of the ASP.NET MVC Data Grid to mitigate any slowdowns when operating with huge numbers of columns. To enable column virtualization, use the <code>.Scrollable(scrollable => scrollable.Virtual(GridVirtualizationMode.Columns))</code> configuration option. As a result, the component will display only part of all its columns, and when the user scrolls the Grid, the visual subset of columns will change accordingly.
</p>
<p>
  You can also use column virtualization together with row virtualization and, in this way, increase the performance substantially of the Data Grid.
