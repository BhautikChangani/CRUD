  <p>Right-to-Left (RTL) support represents the ability of a library, website, or application to handle and respond to users who communicate through right-to-left languages. Right-to-left languages are Arabic, Hebrew, Chinese, Japanese, and others.</p>
  <p>The default language input for web users can be left-to-right or right-to-left. The Telerik UI for ASP.NET MVC Notification supports RTL rendering, thus making your app a truly global one and helping your localization efforts.</p>
  <p>The <a href="https://www.telerik.com/aspnet-mvc/notification" target="_blank">Telerik UI for ASP.NET MVC Notification</a> component comes with built-in right-to-left (RTL) support, offers right-to-left rendering, and can be easily adapted to display right-to-left languages, such as Arabic and Hebrew. If you wrap the helper configuration in a <code>div</code> element with <code>k-rtl</code> class, the Notification content will be rendered in a right-to-left direction.</p>
