<p>
    Use the <a href="https://www.telerik.com/aspnet-mvc/dropdownlist" target="_blank">Telerik UI for
        ASP.NET MVC DropDownList</a> control in any application. Even if you design it for languages like Arabic or
    Hebrew, where users read from right to left. With only a few settings, you can adjust the RTL (Right to Left)
    feature and rearrange the DropDownList in your application.
</p>
<p>
    The demo shows the built-in option for right-to-left rendering for the Telerik UI for ASP.NET MVC DropDownList
    component configured in the div class.
