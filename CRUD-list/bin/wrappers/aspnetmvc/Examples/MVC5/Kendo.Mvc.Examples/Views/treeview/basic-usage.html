        The <a href="https://www.telerik.com/aspnet-mvc/treeview" target="_blank">Telerik UI for ASP.NET MVC TreeView</a> is commonly used to navigate directories and files on a file system. The directory nodes contain subdirectories and files, which are visible on expand. Also, the component can illustrate the hierarchical relationship of items to their peers and nodes.
    </p>
    <p>
      This example demonstrates a basic configuration of the TreeView, where all <a href="https://docs.telerik.com/aspnet-mvc/html-helpers/navigation/treeview/items" target="_blank">nodes are represented with texts and sprites</a>. Rather than including a separate image file for each node, you can set a single image with CSS by using the <code>background-image</code> property, and specify the respective sprite CSS class for each node by using the <code>SpriteCssClasses()</code> option. In this way, the total number of HTTP requests will be reduced.
