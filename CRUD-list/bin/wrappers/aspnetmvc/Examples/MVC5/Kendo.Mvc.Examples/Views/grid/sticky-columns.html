<h2 class="kd-title">Description</h2>
<p>
  Some senarios require you to display a large number of <a href="https://www.telerik.com/aspnet-mvc/grid">Telerik UI for ASP.NET MVC Grid</a> columns on limited screen space, and
  making a small subset of them visible when scrolling the grid horizontally. The concept of sticky columns enables a certain columns to stay visible in the viewable area, yet remaining scrollable with the rest of the non-sticky columns.
</p>
<p>
  The sticky-column feature of the ASP.NET MVC Data Grid is available alongside the implementation of the frozen-column feature. While the locked columns in the Grid are rendered
  on the left side of the component, the sticky columns are displayed in the scrollable area with the non-frozen columns.
</p>
<p>
  The Data Grid allows you to implement the sticky-column feature by setting the <code>.Sticky()</code> configuration of the corresponding column to <code>true</code>, which, as a result, will render the column as sticky. To allow the user to stick or unstick a certain column from the <strong>Column Menu</strong>, use the <code>.Stickable(true)</code> corresponding setting.
</p> 
<p>
  This demo shows how to implement sticky columns in the Data Grid and displays the <strong>Ship Address</strong> column as sticky.
