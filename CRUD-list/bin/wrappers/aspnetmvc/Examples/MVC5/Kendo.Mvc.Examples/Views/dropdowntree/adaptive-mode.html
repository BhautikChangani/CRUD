    <p>The <a href="https://www.telerik.com/aspnet-mvc/dropdowntree" target="_blank">Telerik UI for ASP.NET MVC DropDownTree</a> supports an adaptive mode that provides a mobile-friendly rendering of its suggestion list popup.</p>
    <p>The functionality is enabled via the <code>.AdaptiveMode()</code> - when it is set to <code>AdaptiveMode.Auto</code> the popup of the component will automatically adapt to the current screen size and will change its rendering accordingly. On medium-sized screens, the suggestion list will be shown as a modal docked to the bottom. On smaller screens a full-screen modal dialog will be used. In all other cases, a standard popup rendering anchored to the bottom of the input will be used.</p>
