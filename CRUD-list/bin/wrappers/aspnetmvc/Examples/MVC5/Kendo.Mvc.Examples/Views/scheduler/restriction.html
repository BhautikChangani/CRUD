        The <a href="https://www.telerik.com/aspnet-mvc/scheduler" target="_blank">Telerik UI for ASP.NET MVC Scheduler</a> delivers client-side API options for restricting its events thus providing you with better control over your resources. You can prevent the dragging and resizing of the appointments, and also the creatiing of a new event or the modification of an existing one by criteria defined by you.

        For example, in the demo, double-click on the <strong>Call Charlie about the project</strong> event, change the attendee to Bob and click <strong>Save</strong>. These actions will result into a <strong>This person is not available in this time period.</strong> error.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you change the start date of the <strong>HR Lecture</strong> event to <strong>10:30 AM</strong>, you will also get a <strong>This person is not available in this time period.</strong> error.
