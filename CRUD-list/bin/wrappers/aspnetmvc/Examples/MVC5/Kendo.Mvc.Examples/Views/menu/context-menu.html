<p>
    The <a target="_blank" href="https://www.telerik.com/aspnet-mvc/menu">Telerik UI for ASP.NET MVC ContextMenu</a> is a component that displays menu items when users perform a right-click action on desktop or touch actions on mobile devices. In a desktop environment, you also have the option to define another way for opening the ContextMenu such as left-click or other pointer and mouse events. You can add a list of items to the ContextMenu too, create multi-level menus, and attach event handlers to the Menu items for seamless integration with other controls such the ListView, as shown in this demo.
