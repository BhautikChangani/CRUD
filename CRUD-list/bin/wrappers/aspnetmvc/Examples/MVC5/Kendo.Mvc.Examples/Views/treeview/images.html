    <p>The <a href="https://www.telerik.com/aspnet-mvc/treeview" target="_blank">Telerik UI for ASP.NET MVC TreeView</a> enables you to add images to each of its nodes and improve the user experience. For example, you can set the image URL through the <code>ImageUrl()</code> method as demonstrated in this example, which will render the nodes of the first TreeView with an image and text.</p>
    <p>Another option is to use <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Images/Implementing_image_sprites_in_CSS" target="_blank">sprites</a>. Sprites are a collection of image files combined into a single file that is loaded on the page with the <code>background-image</code> CSS property. Then, specify the respective sprite CSS class for each node by using the <code>SpriteCssClasses()</code> method. As a result, the sprite images will be loaded on the page through a single HTTP request. The second TreeView in this example is implemented with sprites.</p>
