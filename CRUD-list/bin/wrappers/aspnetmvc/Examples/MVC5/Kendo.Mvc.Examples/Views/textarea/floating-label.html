    <p>The <a href="https://docs.telerik.com/aspnet-mvc/html-helpers/editors/textarea/labels#floating-label" target="_blank">Telerik UI for ASP.NET MVC TextArea</a> supports a floating label funtionality. The floating label displays placeholder text inside the component and, then, animates outside of it to “float” above the element when the component is focused. To configure the floating label, set the <code> label.Floating(true);</code> configuration option.</p>
    <p>The greatest thing is that with Telerik UI for ASP.NET MVC you get the floating label of the TextArea as a built-in feature as it is really tricky to implement the feature correctly for all browsers and devices.</p>
    <p>This demo shows how to use the floating label functionality of the TextArea which, in this case, prompts the user to fill in their name.</p>
