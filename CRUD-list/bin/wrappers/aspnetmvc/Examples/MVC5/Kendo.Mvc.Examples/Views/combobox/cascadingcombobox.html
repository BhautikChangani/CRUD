<h2 class="kd-title">Description</h2>
<p>
    The <a target="_blank" href="https://www.telerik.com/aspnet-mvc/combobox">Telerik UI for ASP.NET MVC ComboBox</a> supports the implementation of cascading ComboBoxes. A cascading ComboBox is a series of two or more ComboBoxes in which each ComboBox is filtered based on the selected options in the previous ComboBox.
</p> 
<p>
  This demo shows three ComboBoxes, each enabled and filtered according to the user selection in the previous field. The child components are disabled and have a <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.telerik.com/aspnet-mvc/api/kendo.mvc.ui.fluent/comboboxbuilder#cascadefromsystemstring"><code>CascadeFrom</code></a> property with a specified category from which they draw information and filter the data.
