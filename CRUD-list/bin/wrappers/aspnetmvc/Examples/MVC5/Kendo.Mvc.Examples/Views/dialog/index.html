<p>
  The <a target="_blank" href="https://www.telerik.com/aspnet-mvc/dialog-for-mvc">Telerik Dialog for ASP.NET MVC</a> is a modal popup that brings information to the user, prompts the user for input or asks for a decision.
  The component provides fully customizable visual appearance of its title and body and support for rich text content, features predefined <strong>Alert</strong>, <strong>Confirm</strong>, and <strong>Prompt</strong> dialogs as well as built-in modality and animations, and enables you to create and add custom actions (buttons) and use the built-in themes.  
  The component can also contain more complex UI elements that focus the attention of the user.
