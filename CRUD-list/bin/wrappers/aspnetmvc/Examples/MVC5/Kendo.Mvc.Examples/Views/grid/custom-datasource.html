<h2 class="kd-title">Description</h2>
<p>
  The <a href="https://www.telerik.com/aspnet-mvc/grid" target="_blank">Telerik UI for ASP.NET MVC Data Grid</a> enables you to bypass the built-in data processing and handle operations such paging, sorting, filtering, and grouping yourself.
</p>
<p>
  This demo shows how to bind the Data Grid to a custom data source when none of the built-in types are suitable. To make the connection to the remote endpoint and process the data properly, the data source requires information about the web service URLs, the request type, the response data type, and the structure (schema) of the response.
