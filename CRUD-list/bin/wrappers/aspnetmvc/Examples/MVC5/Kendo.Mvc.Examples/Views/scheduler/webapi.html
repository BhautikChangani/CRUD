        The <a href="https://www.telerik.com/aspnet-mvc/scheduler" target="_blank">Telerik UI for ASP.NET MVC Scheduler</a> supports the implementation of the CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Destroy) data operations and a WebAPI controller. A WebAPI is a concept referring to APIs over the web, which can be accessed through the HTTP protocol and which are typically used with JavaScript. A WebAPI controller manages the incoming HTTP requests and sends back a response to the caller.

        This demo shows how to bind the Scheduler in a WebAPI. By specifying the DataSource type as
        <code>.WebApi()</code>, the requests will be sent to the endpoints of the WebAPI in the expected format out of the box.
