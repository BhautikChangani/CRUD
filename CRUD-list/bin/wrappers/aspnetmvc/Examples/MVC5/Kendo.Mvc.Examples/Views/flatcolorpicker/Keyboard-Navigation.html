<h3>Focus</h3>
<p>The Telerik UI for ASP.NET MVC FlatColorPicker is a single-tab-stop component. It implements inner navigation that can be activated by pressing the Enter key. When inner navigation is activated, the focus is trapped within the component. To return to the page navigation, the user must press Esc.</p>
