<h2 class="kd-title">Description</h2>
<p>
  The <a href="https://www.telerik.com/aspnet-mvc/grid">Telerik UI for ASP.NET MVC Grid</a> enables users to export data to XLSX (Excel) and CSV. This type of export is
  recommended when the Grid displays huge sets of data, which are resource intensive, as the approach eliminates the requirement to serialize the entire
  dataset and create the file on the client. The file is produced on the server and pushed to the client as a <code>File</code>
  object.
</p>
<p>
  This demo illustrates the configuration of the <code>Server</code> exporting option for all rows. You can also export only selected rows by including the <code>.Selectable()</code> property, or by adding a checkbox column for selection with
  <code>.Columns (columns => { columns.Select().Width(80); })</code>.
