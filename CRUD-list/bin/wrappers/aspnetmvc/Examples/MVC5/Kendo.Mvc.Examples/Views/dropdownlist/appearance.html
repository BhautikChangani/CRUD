    The <a href="https://www.telerik.com/aspnet-mvc/dropdownlist" target="_blank">Telerik UI for
        ASP.NET MVC DropDownList</a> lets the user choose one option from a list of choices. This demo shows
    different configuration settings that control the styling of the component.

<p><b>Note:</b> The styling options showcased in this demo support only the default values when using the LESS themes.

    added to the options in the future.</p>
