<h2 class="kd-title">Description</h2>
<p>
  A GraphQL service is served over the HTTP protocol through a single endpoint that responds by using JSON and
  expresses the full set of capabilities of the API. 
</p>
<p>
  The <a href="https://www.telerik.com/aspnet-mvc/grid">Telerik UI for ASP.NET MVC Grid</a> supports a GraphQL 
  data-binding approach, which enables the component to consume data from an ASP.NET MVC GraphQL Service that is available for
  review in the <a href="https://github.com/telerik/kendo-ui-demos-service/tree/master/graphql/graphql-aspnet-core">GraphQLService Repository</a>, as demonstrated by this demo.
</p>
