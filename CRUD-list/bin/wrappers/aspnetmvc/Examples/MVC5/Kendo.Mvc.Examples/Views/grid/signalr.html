<p>
  SignalR allows you to add real-time functionality to your <a href="https://www.telerik.com/aspnet-mvc/grid">Telerik UI for
          ASP.NET MVC Grid</a>. SignalR takes care of everything behind the scenes
  that makes real-time client-to-server and server-to-client communications possible. This type of communication is useful in collaborative
  scenarios where multiple parties are editing the Grid simultaneously or in apps that utilize push notifications.
</p>
<p>
  This demo shows how to bind the Data Grid
  to a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/signalr/?view=aspnetcore-2.1">SignalR</a> Hub for real-time push notifications. This binding approach is useful for web applications, such as chat and gaming, which require high-frequency
  updates where you usually want to perform Grid updates in real-time on all connected clients.</p>
<p>
  To configure the SignalR binding, set the <code>SignalR</code> and <code>Transport</code> settings in the
  DataSource configuration of the Data Grid component. In this way, you instruct the 
  data source to use the SignalR protocol for
  transmitting and operating with data in real time.
