      Right-to-Left (RTL) support represents the ability of a library, website, or application to handle and respond to users who communicate through right-to-left languages. Right-to-left languages are Arabic, Hebrew, Chinese, Japanese, and others.
    </p>
    <p>
      The default language input for web users can be left-to-right or right-to-left. The Telerik UI for ASP.NET MVC Scheduler supports both input modes enabling you to properly render a spectrum of languages, including Hebrew, Chinese, and Arabic, thus making your app a truly global one and helping your localization efforts.

      The <a href="https://www.telerik.com/aspnet-mvc/scheduler" target="_blank">Telerik UI for ASP.NET MVC Scheduler</a> component comes with built-in right-to-left (RTL) support and offers right-to-left rendering.

      This demo shows how to set the Scheduler RTL functionality by registering the <strong>kendo.rtl.min.css</strong> file from the <code>Kendo.Mvc.Examples\Content\web\</code> installation folder and wrap the Scheduler in a container element with <code>k-rtl</code> class set for it.
