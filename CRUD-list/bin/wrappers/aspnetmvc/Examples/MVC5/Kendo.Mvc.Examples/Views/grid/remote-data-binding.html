<p>
  The <a href="https://www.telerik.com/aspnet-mvc/grid">Telerik UI for ASP.NET MVC Grid</a> offers the following generic ways of data-binding:
</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
  <li><a href="https://docs.telerik.com/aspnet-mvc/html-helpers/data-management/grid/binding/ajax-binding" target="_blank">Ajax binding</a>&#8212;The Data Grid component performs server-side requests when doing paging, sorting, and filtering. 
  In this mode, the Grid retrieves only the data representing the current page in JSON format. 
  As a result, only the component is updated.</li>
  <li>Client operations&#8212;You can perform all Data Grid data operations on the client or pass the model
  through the view by setting the <code>ServerOperations(false)</code> of the DataSource.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  To implement the remote data-binding approach, you need to specify a remote endpoint or web service returning data in a JSON/JSONP, OData, or XML format, and utilize the DataSource as a mediator between the Data Grid and the underlying data.
</p>
<p>
  This example demonstrates how the Grid fetches its data from an MVC controller that is assigned through the DataSource <code>read</code> configuration. In addition to the visualization, the Grid also provides built-in support for data operations such as sorting, filtering, and paging.
