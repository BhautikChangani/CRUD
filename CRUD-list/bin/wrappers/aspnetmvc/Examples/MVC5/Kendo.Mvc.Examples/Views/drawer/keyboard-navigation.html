  <p>Keyboard navigation provides all web and app users with a fast keyboard-only navigation capability and is also part of the web accessibility features--it enables users with disabilities to fully control their website or app access through the keyboard.</p>
  <p>By default, users can only navigate to links, buttons, and form controls with a keyboard. The navigation order in which interactive items receive keyboard focus has to be logical and intuitive. Generally, keyboard navigation logic needs to follow the visual horizontal and vertical flow of the page, for example, left to right and top to bottom, header first followed by the main and then the page navigation.</p>
  <p>The <a href="https://docs.telerik.com/aspnet-mvc/html-helpers/navigation/drawer/accessibility/overview" target="_blank">Drawer keyboard navigation</a> is enabled by default, as demonstrated in this demo.</p>
  <p>This Drawer example is part of a unique collection of hundreds of ASP.NET MVC demos, with which you can see all <a href="https://demos.telerik.com/aspnet-mvc/" target="_blank">Telerik UI for ASP.NET MVC components</a> and their features in action. View the source code of the demos from the library or directly adapt and edit their theme appearance in the <a href="https://themebuilder.telerik.com/" target="_blank">ThemeBuilder</a>.</p>
  <p>The Drawer supports the following keyboard shortcuts:</p>
