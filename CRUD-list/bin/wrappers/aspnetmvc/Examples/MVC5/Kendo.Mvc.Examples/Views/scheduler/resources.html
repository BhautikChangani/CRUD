        The <a href="https://www.telerik.com/aspnet-mvc/scheduler" target="_blank">Telerik UI for ASP.NET MVC Scheduler</a> allows you to assign Scheduler events to a set of predefined resources. The resources can be divided in the following way:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://docs.telerik.com/aspnet-mvc/html-helpers/scheduling/scheduler/resources#single-instance-resources" target="_blank">Single-instance resources</a>â€“When only a single instance can be assigned to a Scheduler event. This, for example, can be a list of meetings (Scheduler events), which are held in two rooms (resources). Since a meeting can be held in only one room, it can be considered a single resource.</li>
        <li><a href="https://docs.telerik.com/aspnet-mvc/html-helpers/scheduling/scheduler/resources#multiple-instance-resources" target="_blank">Multiple-instance resources</a>-When two or more instances can be assigned to a Scheduler event. This, for example, can be a list of meetings and meeting attendees. Since more than one attendee can participate in a meeting, it is considered a multiple-instance resource. You can enable the multiple-instance feature by setting the <code>Resources</code> configuration to <code>.Multiple(true)</code>.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The Scheduler also supports unlimited resource types. For example, you can combine single and multiple resources, as shown in this demo.
