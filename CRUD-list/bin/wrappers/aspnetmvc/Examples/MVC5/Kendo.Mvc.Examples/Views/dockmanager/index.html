  The <a href="https://www.telerik.com/aspnet-mvc/dockmanager" target="_blank">Telerik UI for ASP.NET MVC DockManager</a> is a UI component that replicates the docks, along with their behaviors, in desktop applications like Visual Studio.
  Once rendered, docks can be moved around, can be docked or pinned to certain areas, and there will also be a dock management overlay that pops up to make actions like adding the pane to the top, right, bottom, or left areas and the component will automatically adjust its layout when these actions are taken.
</p>    
<p>      
    The following example showcases a more complex scenario in which the DockManager can be utilized amongst other components.
