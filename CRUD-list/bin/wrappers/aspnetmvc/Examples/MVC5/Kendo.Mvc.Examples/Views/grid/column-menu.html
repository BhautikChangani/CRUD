<h2 class="kd-title">Description</h2>
<p>
  Out of the box, the <a href="https://www.telerik.com/aspnet-mvc/grid" target="_blank">Telerik UI for ASP.NET MVC Data Grid</a> provides a column menu functionality. The column menu feature allows you to configure a menu with additional options from which the user can pick and also show, hide, filter, and sort the Data Grid columns if filtering and sorting are enabled.
</p>
<p>
  To display the column menu of the ASP.NET MVC Data Grid, use the <code>ColumnMenu(true)</code> method. As a result, the component will render the column menu in its header cells as an ellipsis (a set of three dots), as demonstrated in this demo.
</p>
<p>
  The Telerik UI for ASP.NET MVC Data Grid supports three types of Column Menu - <code>classic</code>, <code>modern</code>, and <code>tabbed</code>. Use the DropDownList to switch between types and examine the different renering.
