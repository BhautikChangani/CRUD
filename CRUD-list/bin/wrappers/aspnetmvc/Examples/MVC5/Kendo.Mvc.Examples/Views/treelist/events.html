    <p>The <a href="https://www.telerik.com/aspnet-mvc/treelist" target="_blank">Telerik for ASP.NET MVC TreeList component</a> supports a comprehensive set of events which enable you to provide a fluent experience and smooth interaction with the component. All events are handled in the <strong>Console Log</strong> when you interact with the component.</p>
    <p>This demo shows how to handle the <code>Edit</code> event, which is fired when the user creates or edits a row, the <code>Save</code> event, which is fired when a row is saved, the <code>Remove</code> event, which is fired when a row is removed, the <code>DataBound</code> event, which is fired when the component is bound to data from data source, and the <code>DataBinding</code> event, which is fired before the component is bound to data from the data source.</p>
