    <p>The <a href="https://www.telerik.com/aspnet-mvc/combobox" target="_blank">Telerik UI for ASP.NET MVC ComboBox component</a> supports the floating label feature. A floating label moves above the input when it is focused.</p>
    <p>With the Telerik UI for ASP.NET MVC, you get the ComboBox floating label as a built-in feature you can use on the fly as it is really tricky to implement it correctly for all browsers and devices.</p>
    <p>This demo shows how to set both the floating label and its content in the ComboBox through the <code>.Label()</code> configuration option.</p>
