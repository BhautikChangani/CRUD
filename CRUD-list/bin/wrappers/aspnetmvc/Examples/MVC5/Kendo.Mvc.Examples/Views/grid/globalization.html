<p>
  Globalization is a process which combines web applications adaptation to meet the requirements of local markets and different languages (localization) with their adaptation to specific cultures (internationalization). 
</p>
<p>
  The <a href="https://docs.telerik.com/aspnet-mvc/html-helpers/data-management/grid/globalization/overview" target="_blank">ASP.NET MVC Data Grid delivers globalization</a> through the translation of its messages with adapting them to specific cultures and right-to-left support, as demonstrated is this demo. 
</p>
<p>
  <a href="https://docs.telerik.com/aspnet-mvc/globalization/overview" target="_blank">Telerik UI for ASP.NET MVC</a> provides globalization features through the supported internationalization and localization approaches. The internationalization feature applies the desired cultures by providing services for defining these cultures, and parsing and formatting dates and numbers. The Telerik UI for ASP.NET MVC localization services include the available <a href="https://docs.telerik.com/aspnet-mvc/globalization/right-to-left-support" target="_blank">RTL mode of Telerik UI for ASP.NET MVC components</a> and the ability to <a href="https://docs.telerik.com/aspnet-mvc/globalization/localization" target="_blank">change their displayed messages</a> by adding an additional script file in the document.
</p>
<p>
 This demo shows how to change the culture and language in which the Data Grid messages are displayed. 
 The Telerik UI culture defines specific information for the number
 formats, week and month names, date and time formats, and more. The Telerik UI
 culture scripts are generated from the Windows 10 and .NET 4.7
 server-side culture definitions and match them by design. 
</p>
<p>
  The demo also shows how the selected culture from the <a href="https://www.telerik.com/aspnet-mvc/dropdownlist" target="_blank">Telerik UI for ASP.NET MVC DropDownList</a>
  updates the server culture. This behavior enables the Telerik UI for ASP.NET MVC Grid to use the
  matching Resource file messages and localize them accordingly. The
  <code><a href="https://docs.telerik.com/kendo-ui/api/javascript/kendo/methods/culture"target=" _blank">kendo.culture()</a></code> method sets the client cluture to force the Data Grid to use the matching date,
  number, currency, week, and month formats.
</p>
<p>
  The Telerik UI messages are community-sourced. If a translation is missing from the Resource messages, the Grid will use the default "en-US" messages.
</p>
