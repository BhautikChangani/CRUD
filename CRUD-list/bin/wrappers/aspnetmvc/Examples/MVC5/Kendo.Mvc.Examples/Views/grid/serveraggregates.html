<h2 class="kd-title">Description</h2>
<p>
  In some situations, when displaying numbers in the <a href="https://www.telerik.com/aspnet-mvc/grid">Telerik UI for ASP.NET MVC Grid</a>, users need to see the results
  from aggregate calculations at the bottom of the Data Grid groups or columns.
</p>
<p>
  The ASP.NET MVC Grid offers built-in support for the most popular aggregate functions such as <code>Average</code>, <code>Count</code>, <code>Sum</code>, <code>Min</code>, <code>Max</code>, and <code>Count</code>. When the Grid is configured for server binding, the
  aggregates are also calculated on the server side. The whole Grid content with the aggregates calculated are pushed as HTML to the client.
