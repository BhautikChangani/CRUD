<h2 class="kd-title">Description</h2>
<p>
  The <a href="https://www.telerik.com/aspnet-mvc/grid">Telerik UI for ASP.NET MVC Grid</a> supports a comprehensive set of events which enable you to provide fluent experience and smooth interaction with the component, and provide easy configuration or extension points for customization on top of its built-in features.
</p>
<p>
  This demo shows how to intercept the <code>Change</code>, <code>DataBinding</code>, and <code>DataBound</code> events of the Data Grid to output messages in the console when these events are raised. You can also use these events for customization or to execute custom logic if necessary.
</p>
<p>
  The Telerik UI for ASP.NET MVC Grid triggers events for each user interaction as well such as <code>Filter</code>, <code>Group</code>, <code>Sort</code>, <code>BeforeEdit</code>, <code>Save</code>, <code>Cancel</code>, and more. 
</p>
<p>  
  For all client-side events you can use in the component, refer to the <a href="https://docs.telerik.com/kendo-ui/api/javascript/ui/grid#events"target=" _blank">API documentation of the Data Grid</a>.
