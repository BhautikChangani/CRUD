<h2 class="kd-title">Description</h2>
<p>
  The <a href="https://www.telerik.com/aspnet-mvc/grid" target="_blank">Telerik UI for ASP.NET MVC Data Grid</a> comes with a column-resizing feature, which can be enabled by using the <code>Resizable(true)</code> method. As a result, users can resize columns by dragging the edges (resize handles) of their header cells and also automatically fit a column by double-clicking its resize handle, similar to Excel.
