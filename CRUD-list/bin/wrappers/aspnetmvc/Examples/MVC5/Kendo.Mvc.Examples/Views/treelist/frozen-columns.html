    <p>The <a href="https://www.telerik.com/aspnet-mvc/treelist" target="_blank">Telerik for ASP.NET MVC TreeList component</a> provides the opportunity to <a href="https://docs.telerik.com/aspnet-mvc/html-helpers/data-management/treelist/columns/locked-columns" target="_blank">lock (freeze) columns</a> to a specific position, which is always visible while the user scrolls horizontally.</p>
    <p>For the feature to work properly, you need to make sure that:</p>
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>Scrolling is enabled.</li>
        <li>At least one column is initially locked.</li>
        <li>The height of the TreeList is defined.</li>
        <li>Explicit pixel widths are set to all columns.</li>
        <li>The total width of all locked columns is either the same, or less than the width of the TreeList minus three times the width of the scrollbar.</li>
        <li>The TreeList is not initialized in a hidden container.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The current example shows a basic TreeList configuration with locked columns as well as features like sorting, column resizing, and reordering while having its column menu enabled.</p>
