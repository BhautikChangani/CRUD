            The word "Brazil" likely comes from the Portuguese word for brazilwood, a tree that once grew plentifully
            along
            the Brazilian coast. In Portuguese, brazilwood is called pau-brasil, with the word brasil commonly given the
            etymology "red like an ember", formed from brasa ("ember") and the suffix -il (from -iculum or -ilium). As
            brazilwood produces a deep red dye, it was highly valued by the European textile industry and was the
            earliest
            commercially exploited product from Brazil. Throughout the 16th century, massive amounts of brazilwood were
            harvested by indigenous peoples (mostly Tupi) along the Brazilian coast, who sold the timber to European
            traders
            (mostly Portuguese, but also French) in return for assorted European consumer goods.

        <div id="chile" tabindex="0">
            There are various theories about the origin of the word Chile. According to 17th-century Spanish chronicler
            Diego de Rosales, the Incas called the valley
            of the Aconcagua Chili by corruption of the name of a Picunche tribal chief (cacique) called Tili, who ruled
            the
            area at the time of the Incan conquest in the 15th century. Another theory points to the similarity of the
            valley of the Aconcagua with that of the Casma Valley in Peru, where there was a town and valley named
            Chili.

        <div id="colombia" tabindex="0">
            The name "Colombia" is derived from the last name of the Italian navigator Christopher Columbus. It was
            conceived by the Venezuelan revolutionary Francisco de Miranda as a reference to all of the New World, but
            especially to those portions under Spanish law. The name was later adopted by the Republic of Colombia of
            1819,
            formed from the territories of the old Viceroyalty of New Granada (modern-day Colombia, Panama, Venezuela,
            Ecuador, and northwest Brazil).

        <div id="ecuador" tabindex="0">
            The origin of the name of Ecuador is from Spain. When the Spaniards colonized the land they called it "el
            ecuador" which translated means "the equator".

        <div id="guyana" tabindex="0">
            The name "Guyana" derives from Guiana, the original name for the region that formerly included Guyana
            (British
            Guiana), Suriname (Dutch Guiana), French Guiana, and parts of Colombia, Venezuela and Brazil. According to
            the
            Oxford English Dictionary, "Guyana" comes from an indigenous Amerindian language and means "land of many
            waters".
