<p>
  The <a href="https://www.telerik.com/aspnet-mvc/grid">Telerik UI for ASP.NET MVC Grid</a> 
  provides a built-in PDF export functionality. The PDF format is very popular and widely used to present documents independently from the application software, hardware, and operating systems.
</p>  
<p> 
  This demo shows how to export the content of the ASP.NET MVC Data Grid to PDF by using a straightforward approach&#8212;to export the content of the component to PDF, include the corresponding command to its toolbar by setting <code>.ToolBar(tools => <strong>tools.Pdf()</strong>)</code>. For greater control over the
  output, configure the PDF export setting. For instance, you can specify the file name and whether to export all
  pages, margins, paper size, font, and so on. To initiate the PDF export programmatically, call the
  <code><a href="https://docs.telerik.com/kendo-ui/api/javascript/ui/grid/methods/saveaspdf" target="_blank">saveAsPdf()</a></code>
  method from the client-side API.
</p>
<p>
  Additionally, you can customize the appearance of the exported Data Grid
  table by providing a template through the <code>.Pdf(pdf => pdf.TemplateId("page-template"))</code> method.
</p>
<p>
  This demo also demonstrates how to exclude a Grid column from export by configuring the <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.telerik.com/aspnet-mvc/html-helpers/data-management/grid/export/pdf-export#exclude-column-from-exporting">Exportable</a> setting.
