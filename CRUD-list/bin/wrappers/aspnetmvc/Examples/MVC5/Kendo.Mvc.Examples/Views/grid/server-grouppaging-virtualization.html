<p>
  The <a href="https://www.telerik.com/aspnet-mvc/grid">Telerik UI for ASP.NET MVC
  Grid</a> provides a group-paging feature, which allows you to page through groups and load the group
  items on demand. The loading of group items is executed when a group is expanded. 
  Group paging works with both local and
  remote data.

<p>
  This demo presents a remotely-bound Data Grid with virtualization and enabled group paging functionality.
