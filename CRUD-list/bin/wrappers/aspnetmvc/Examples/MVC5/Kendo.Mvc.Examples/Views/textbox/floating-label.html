    <p>The <a href="https://docs.telerik.com/aspnet-mvc/html-helpers/editors/textbox/labels#floating-label" target="_blank">Floating Label of the Telerik UI for ASP.NET MVC TextBox</a> displays the type of input a field requires and is one of the most common ways to guide the users of your apps. The Floating Label can be configured by setting the <code>Floating</code> property to <code>true</code>.</p>
    <p>The greatest thing is that with Telerik UI for ASP.NET MVC you get the TextBox Floating Label as a built-in feature as it is really tricky to implement it correctly for all browsers and devices.</p>
    <p>This demo shows how to use the floating label functionality of the TextBox which, in this case, prompts the user to fill in their name.</p>
