<p>
    The <a href="https://www.telerik.com/aspnet-mvc/dropdownlist" target="_blank">Telerik UI for
        ASP.NET MVC DropDownList</a> supports easy grouping of items within its list. The ASP.NET MVC DropDownList
    allows you to easily group similar items into categories. These groups are visual aids that ease the navigation and
    enhance the user experience.

<p>
    In this demo you can see how
    to apply the grouping feature by specifying the field by which you want the elements to be grouped by in the
    <b>.Group</b> configuration option.
