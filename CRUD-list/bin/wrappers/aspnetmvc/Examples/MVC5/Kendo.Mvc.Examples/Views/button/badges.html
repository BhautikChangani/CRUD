    The <a href="https://www.telerik.com/aspnet-mvc/button" target="_blank">Telerik UI for ASP.NET MVC Button</a> comes with built-in badges, which you can use to decorate buttons and to convey additional information through visual notifications.

    The Button also enables you to include badges within the itself and to choose between a set of predefined badge types such as the overlay, dot, pill, and rectangle. You can also specify the badge shape, text, and theme color you require, as demonstrated in this example.
