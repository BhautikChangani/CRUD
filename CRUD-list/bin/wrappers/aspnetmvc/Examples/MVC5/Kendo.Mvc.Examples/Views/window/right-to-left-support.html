<p>
  Right-to-Left (RTL) support represents the ability of a library, website, or application to handle and respond to users who communicate through right-to-left languages. Right-to-left languages are Arabic, Hebrew, Chinese, Japanese, and others. 
</p>
<p>
  The default language input for web users can be left-to-right or right-to-left. The <a href="https://www.telerik.com/aspnet-mvc/window" target="_blank">Telerik UI for ASP.NET MVC Window</a> supports both input modes enabling you to properly render a spectrum of languages, including Hebrew, Chinese, and Arabic, thus making your app a truly global one and helping your localization efforts.
</p>
<p>
  The Telerik UI for ASP.NET MVC Window component comes with built-in right-to-left (RTL) support and offers right-to-left rendering. 
</p>
<p>
  This demo shows how to set the Window RTL functionality by specifying <code>k-rtl</code> in the <code>div</code> class.
