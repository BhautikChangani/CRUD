      Globalization is a process which combines web applications adaptation to meet the requirements of local markets and different languages (localization) with their adaptation to specific cultures (internationalization).
    </p>
    <p>
      The <a href="https://www.telerik.com/aspnet-mvc/scheduler" target="_blank">Telerik UI for ASP.NET MVC Scheduler</a> supports globalization through the available internationalization and localization approaches. The internationalization feature applies the desired cultures by providing services for defining these cultures, and parsing and formatting dates and numbers.
    </p>
    <p>
      This demos showcases how to combine the internationalization and localization approaches provided by the Scheduler component and apply the existing culture and message translations through the <code>System.Globalization.CultureInfo.DefaultThreadCurrentCulture</code> configuration of the Page.
