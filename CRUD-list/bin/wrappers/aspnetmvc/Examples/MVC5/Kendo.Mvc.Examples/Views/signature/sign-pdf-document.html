    <p>This demo about the <strong>Telerik UI for ASP.NET MVC Signature</strong> component demonstrates how to save the Signature within a PDF file.</p>
    <p>It makes use of the capabilities provided by the <a href="https://www.telerik.com/document-processing-libraries">Telerik Document Processing Libraries</a> to extract the PDF file within a memory file and then re-apply the Signature bytes to create a new PDF document.</p>
    <p>The initial PDF file is conveniently displayed to the user with another component called <a href="https://demos.telerik.com/aspnet-mvc/pdfviewer">Telerik UI for ASP.NET MVC PDFViewer</a>. This component also provides a built-in <strong>Download Button</strong> which can be used to Save the new PDF document with the new Signature applied.</p>
