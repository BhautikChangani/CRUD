  Kinvey Backend Services are a set of cloud-based services that enable developers to build and manage mobile apps
  significantly faster, easier, and in a more scalable way. Kinvey Backend Services can significantly speed up
  development by providing your app with data storage, user management, and server-code execution.

<p>
  The <a href="https://www.telerik.com/aspnet-mvc/grid">Telerik UI for ASP.NET MVC Grid</a> supports the  
  data-binding approach which enables the component to consume data from the <a href="https://www.kinvey.com/" title="Getting started with Kinvey Backend Services" target="_blank">Kinvey Backend Services</a>.
<p>
  Note that the Kinvey Backend Services data source is not yet supported on
  IE11 and earlier because it relies on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing">cross-origin resource sharing</a>.

<p>
  This demo shows how to bind the <a href="https://www.telerik.com/aspnet-mvc/grid">Telerik UI for ASP.NET MVC Grid</a> to a Kinvey Backend Service.
