<h4>Description</h4>
<div class="box demo-description wide">
    <p><a href="https://www.telerik.com/aspnet-mvc" target="_blank">Telerik UI for ASP.NET MVC</a> supports the drag-and-drop feature for many of its components. Depending on the specific component and scenario, dragging and dropping enable you to perform various operations in a fast and efficient way by dragging an element to a dropzone. For example, you can reorder rows inside and outside a table, implement the editing functionality in a component, or reorder tree nodes.</p> 
    <p>Whatever dragging and dropping target as a scenario, the drag-and-drop feature of the Telerik UI for ASP.NET MVC components is based and built upon on the <a href="https://docs.telerik.com/kendo-ui/controls/draganddrop/overview" target="_blank">Kendo UI for jQuery Drag and Drop approach</a>. The Drag and Drop combines the <code>kendoDraggable</code> and <code>kendoDropTarget</code> controls, whose capabilities seamlessly integrate with the whole suite components.</p>
    <p>The <a href="https://www.telerik.com/aspnet-mvc/treelist" target="_blank">Telerik UI for ASP.NET MVC TreeList</a> supports editing by dragging and dropping. When the <strong>Editable.Move</strong> property is set to <strong>true</strong>, the user can drag and drop the rows and, as a result, the TreeList updates the <code>parentId</code> field internally.</p>
    <p>As demonstrated in this example, setting the <strong>Editable.Move.Reorderable</strong> property to <strong>true</strong> enables the nodes of the TreeList to be dragged and dropped across all levels, also allowing the child nodes to change their order within the same parent scope.</p>
