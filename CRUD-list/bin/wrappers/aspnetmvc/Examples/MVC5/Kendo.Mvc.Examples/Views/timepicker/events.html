    <p>The <a href="https://www.telerik.com/aspnet-mvc/timepicker" target="_blank">Telerik UI for ASP.NET MVC TimePicker component</a> supports a comprehensive set of events which enable you to provide fluent experience and smooth interaction with the component such as <code>Change</code>, <code>Open</code>, and <code>Close</code>. All events are handled in the <strong>Console Log</strong> when you interact with the component.</p>
    <p>This demo showcases how to handle the <code>Change</code> event that is fired when the value of the TimePicker is changed, the <code>Open</code> event that is fired when the drop-down list of the TimePicker opens, and the <code>Close</code> event which is fired when the drop-down list of the TimePicker closes.</p>
