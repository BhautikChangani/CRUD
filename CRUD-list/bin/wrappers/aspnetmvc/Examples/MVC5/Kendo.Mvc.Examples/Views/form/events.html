    <p>The <a href="https://www.telerik.com/aspnet-mvc/form" target="_blank">Telerik for ASP.NET MVC Form component</a> supports a comprehensive set of events which enable you to provide a fluent experience and smooth interaction with the component. All events are handled in the <strong>Console Log</strong> when you interact with the component.</p>
    <p>This demo shows how to handle the <code>Change</code> event, which is fired when the user edits a field of the Form, the <code>ValidateField</code> event, which is fired when a field is validated, the <code>Clear</code> event, which is fired when the <strong>Clear</strong> button of the form is clicked and the <code>Submit</code> event, which is fired when a user submits the Form to the server.</p>
