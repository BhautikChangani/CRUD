    <p>The Telerik DateInput for ASP.NET MVC allows you to control its styling options.</p>
    <p><b>Note:</b> The styling options showcased in this demo support only the default values when using the LESS themes.
        You can find more information about this topic in the <a href='https://docs.telerik.com/aspnet-mvc/styles-and-layout/less-themes-migration'>LESS Themes Migration</a> article. As the introduction of the styling options is an ongoing effort, there could be minor changes and touch-ups
        added to the options in the future.
