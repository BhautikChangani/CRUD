<h2 class="kd-title">Description</h2>
<p>The PDF format is used to present documents in a manner independent of application software, hardware and operating systems. The <a href="https://docs.telerik.com/aspnet-mvc/html-helpers/editors/editor/overview" target="_blank">Telerik UI for ASP.NET MVC Editor</a> comes with a built-in option to export its content to PDF.</p> 
<p>To enable the PDF export, add the PDF tool to the toolbox of the component by setting <code>.Tools(tools => tools.Pdf())</code>, as demonstrated in this demo. You can also configure additional export settings by passing a lambda expression to the <code>Pdf</code> attribute. For example, you can specify the file name and whether to export all pages, margins, paper size, font, and so on.</p>
