<p>
  The <a href="https://www.telerik.com/aspnet-mvc/grid">Telerik UI for ASP.NET MVC Grid </a> supports remote validation. The remote validation is a custom validation durin which the Data Grid posts the values to the server with an AJAX request and depending on the response, the component displays a valid or invalid state.
</p> 
<p>
  The validation itself, however, is performed on the server side. When the Grid sends a request for editing or creating a record, a method declared in the <code>[Remote]</code> attribute of the the respective field is executed and, then, returns information on whether the new data is valid or not.
</p>
<p>
  This demo shows how to create a custom validation rule that handles the built-in <code>Remote</code> attributes in your model.
