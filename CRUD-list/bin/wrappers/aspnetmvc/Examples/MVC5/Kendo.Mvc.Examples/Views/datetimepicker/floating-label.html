    <p>The <a href="https://www.telerik.com/aspnet-mvc/datetimepicker" target="_blank">Telerik UI for ASP.NET MVC DateTimePicker component</a> supports the Floating Label featureâ€”a label that will move above the input when it is focused.</p>
    <p>The beneficial thing is that with the Telerik UI for ASP.NET MVC you get the DateTimePicker Floating Label as a built-in feature as it is really intricate to implement it correctly for all browsers and devices.</p>
    <p>This demo shows how to set both the floating label and its content in the DateTimePicker through the <code>.Label()</code> configuration option.</p>
