    <p><a href="https://www.telerik.com/aspnet-mvc/panelbar" target="_blank">Telerik UI for ASP.NET MVC PanelBar</a> enables you to add images and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Images/Implementing_image_sprites_in_CSS" target="_blank">sprites</a> to each item to visually communicate its purpose to the users. For example, you can set the image URL through the <code>ImageUrl()</code> method, as demonstrated in this example where the items of the first PanelBar are rendered with an image and some text.</p>
    <p>Rather than including each image as a separate image file, you can set a single image with CSS by utilizing the <code>background-image</code> property, and specify the respective sprite CSS class for each item by utilizing the <code>SpriteCssClasses()</code> option. In this way, the total number of HTTP requests will be reduced. In the current example, the second PanelBar uses sprites.
