    <p>The <a href="https://www.telerik.com/aspnet-mvc/calendar" target="_blank">Telerik UI for ASP.NET MVC Calendar component</a> allows multiple selection to be performed by the end user by using keyboard combinations for the selection and deselection of dates.</p>
    <p>The selection functionality of the Calendar component supports the following options:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Multiple selection—To select dates, the user utilizes the <code>Ctrl</code> key.</li>
        <li>Range selection—To select ranges of dates, the user utilizes the <code>Shift</code> key.</li>
        <li>Week selection—Represents a range selection for a specific week.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This example demonstrates how to perform multiple selection by using the <a href="https://docs.telerik.com/aspnet-mvc/html-helpers/scheduling/calendar/selection" target="_blank">Selectable</a> configuration option.</p>
    <p>The <code>Ctrl</code> key allows the user to perform multiple selection:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><code>Ctrl</code> + mouse click on a specific date will mark the date as selected. Other previously selected dates will remain selected as well.</li>
        <li>Selecting a date from a specific view without using the <code>Ctrl</code> key will deselect all previously selected dates (including previously selected dates from other views or months), and select the date of the clicked cell.</li>
        <li>Selecting a date that is already selected while holding the <code>Ctrl</code> key will remove the date from the selection.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>When the user clicks on a specific week number, the Calendar selects the entire week. This behavior is considered a special case of range selection, starting from first day of the week and selecting all dates until the end of the week. </p>
    <p>The multiple selection functionality introduces some new key combinations. For more information, refer to the <a href="https://demos.telerik.com/aspnet-mvc/calendar/keyboard-navigation">Keyboard Navigation</a> demo.</p>
