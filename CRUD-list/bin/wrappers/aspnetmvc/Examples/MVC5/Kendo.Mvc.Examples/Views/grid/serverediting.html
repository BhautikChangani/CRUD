<h2 class="kd-title">Description</h2>
<p>
  The <a href="https://www.telerik.com/aspnet-mvc/grid">Telerik UI for
  ASP.NET MVC Grid</a> provides a server edit mode, as demonstrated in this example, which uses <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/form"><code>form</code></a> elements internally when server editing is enabled. This implementation means that you are
  not able to place the Grid in another form element on the page because the nesting of forms is not a
  standard-compliant characteristic.
