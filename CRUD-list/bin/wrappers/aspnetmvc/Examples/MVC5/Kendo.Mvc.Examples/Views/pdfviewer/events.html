    <p>The <a href="https://www.telerik.com/aspnet-mvc/pdf-viewer" target="_blank">Telerik UI for ASP.NET MVC PDFViewer component</a> supports a set of events such as <code>Render</code>, <code>Open</code>, and <code>Error</code>. All events are handled in the <strong>Console Log</strong> when you interact with the component.</p>
    <p>This demo example showcases how to handle the <code>Render</code> event that fires once a page is rendered, the <code>Open</code> event that fires when a PDF file is opened in the viewer, and the <code>Error</code> event which fires when an error is encountered during the loading process of an arbitrary PDF file.</p>
