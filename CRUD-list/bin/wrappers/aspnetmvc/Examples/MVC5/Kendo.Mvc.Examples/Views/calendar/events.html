    <p>The <a href="https://www.telerik.com/aspnet-mvc/calendar" target="_blank">Telerik UI for ASP.NET MVC Calendar</a> supports a set of events which enable you to provide fluent experience and smooth interaction with the component illustrated through the <strong>Console Log</strong> upon interaction. The log will provide a full list of the applied changes in the Calendar.</p>
    <p>This demo shows how to handle the <code>Change</code> event that is triggered when the user sets a date, and the <code>Navigate</code> event that is triggered when the user navigates to a different <strong>Month</strong> view.</p>
