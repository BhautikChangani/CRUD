<p>
  The Grid enables you to calculate aggregates of the selected rows or cells in the table.
</p>
<p>
    As demonstrated in this example, the <a href="https://www.telerik.com/aspnet-mvc/grid">Telerik UI for ASP.NET MVC Grid</a> supports selection aggregates through its <strong>GridSelectionSettingsBuilder</strong>'s <code>CellAggregates</code> property: <br />
</p>
<p>
    <code>.Selectable(selectable => selectable.Mode(GridSelectionMode.Multiple)<br />&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;.CellAggregates(true)<br />)</code>
</p>
<p>To display the aggregates use the <code>StatusBarTemplateHandler</code> property of the Grid.</p>
<p>
  The aggregates are calculated for each selected cell and support <strong>Row</strong>, <strong>Cell</strong> and <strong>Checkbox Selection</strong>.
  For <strong>Checkbox Selection</strong> also set the <code>.CheckboxSelection(true)</code> configuration property.
</p>
<p>
  Additionally, you can persist the calculated selection aggregates of the Grid across its pages with the use of its
  <code>PersistSelection(true)</code> method.
</p>
