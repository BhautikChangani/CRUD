    <p>The <a href="https://www.telerik.com/aspnet-mvc/upload" target="_blank">Telerik UI Upload for ASP.NET MVC component</a> exposes a large set of events such as <code>Complete</code>, <code>Upload</code> ,<code>Error</code> and more. All handled in the <strong>Console Log</strong> when you interact with the component.</p>
    <p>This demo showcases how to handle the <code>Select</code> event that is fired when the user selects a file to be uploaded in the component, the <code>Upload</code> that is triggered when a file is about to be uploaded, and the <code>Progress</code> event fired when the data about the progress of the uploaded file is available.</p>
