<p>
  Globalization is a process which combines web applications adaptation to meet the requirements of local markets and different languages (localization) with their adaptation to specific cultures (internationalization).

  The <a href="https://www.telerik.com/aspnet-mvc/datepicker">Telerik UI for ASP.NET MVC DatePicker</a> supports <a href="https://docs.telerik.com/aspnet-mvc/html-helpers/editors/datepicker/globalization/overview" target="_blank">globalization as a feature</a> and is designed to work in different cultures and respond to their requirements for date and time formatting, week and month names, as demonstrated is this demo. You can define the culture of the component through its <code>kendo.culture()</code> method.

  <a href="https://docs.telerik.com/aspnet-mvc/globalization/overview" target="_blank">Telerik UI for ASP.NET MVC</a> provides globalization features through the supported internationalization and localization approaches. The internationalization feature applies the desired cultures by providing services for defining these cultures, and parsing and formatting dates and numbers. The Telerik UI for ASP.NET MVC localization services include the available <a href="https://docs.telerik.com/aspnet-mvc/html-helpers/editors/datepicker/globalization/rtl-support" target="_blank">RTL mode of Telerik UI for ASP.NET MVC components</a> and the ability to <a href="https://docs.telerik.com/aspnet-mvc/globalization/localization" target="_blank">change their displayed messages</a> by adding an additional script file in the document.
