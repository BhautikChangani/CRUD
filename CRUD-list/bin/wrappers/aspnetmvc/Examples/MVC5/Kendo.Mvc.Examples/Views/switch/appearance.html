    <p>The <a href="https://www.telerik.com/aspnet-mvc/mvc-switch" target="_blank">Telerik UI for ASP.NET MVC Switch</a> offers various options which allow you to control its appearanceâ€“size, track radius, and thumb radius, as demonstrated in this example.</p>    
    <p>You can also easily switch between the available <a href="https://docs.telerik.com/aspnet-mvc/styles-and-layout/sass-themes/overview" target="_blank">themes</a> and <a href="https://docs.telerik.com/aspnet-mvc/styles-and-layout/sass-themes/swatches" target="_blank">swatches</a>. When you are satisfied with the result, it is easy to check and even copy the source code of the Switch.</p> 
    <p>The showcased styling options support only the default values when using the LESS themes. You can find more information about this topic in the <a href="https://docs.telerik.com/aspnet-mvc/styles-and-layout/less-themes/less-themes-migration" target="_blank">LESS Themes Migration article</a>. As the introduction of the styling options is an ongoing effort, there may be minor changes and touch-ups added to the options in the future.</p>
    <p>The R1 2022 release introduces new rendering for several components. In the long run, the team will make similar rendering improvements to most of the UI components in the suite. <a href="https://docs.telerik.com/aspnet-mvc/styles-and-layout/components-rendering-overview" target="_blank">These are breaking changes that affect both the SASS and the LESS-based themes.</a></p>
