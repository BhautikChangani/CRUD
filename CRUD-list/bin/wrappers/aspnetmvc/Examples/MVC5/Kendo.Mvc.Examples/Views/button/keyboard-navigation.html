    <p>Keyboard navigation provides all web and app users with a fast keyboard-only navigation capability and is also part of the web accessibility features--it enables users with disabilities to fully control their website or app access through the keyboard.</p>
    <p>By default, users can only navigate to links, buttons, and form controls with a keyboard. The navigation order in which interactive items receive keyboard focus has to be logical and intuitive. Generally, keyboard navigation logic needs to follow the visual horizontal and vertical flow of the page, for example, left to right and top to bottom, header first followed by the main and then the page navigation.</p>
    <p>The <a href="https://docs.telerik.com/aspnet-mvc/html-helpers/navigation/button/accessibility/overview" target="_blank">Button keyboard navigation</a> is enabled by default, as demonstrated in this demo.</p>
    <p>The Button supports the following keyboard shortcuts:</p>
