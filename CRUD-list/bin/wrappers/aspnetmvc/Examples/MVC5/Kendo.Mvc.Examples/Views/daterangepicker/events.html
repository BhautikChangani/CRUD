    <p>The <a href="https://www.telerik.com/aspnet-mvc/mvc-daterangepicker" target="_blank">Telerik DateRangePicker for ASP.NET MVC component</a> supports a comprehensive set of events which enable you to provide a fluent experience and smooth interaction with the component. All events are handled in the <strong>Console Log</strong> when you interact with the component.</p>
    <p>This demo shows how to handle the <code>Change</code> event which is fired when the selected date is changed, the <code>Close</code> event which is fired when the calendar is closed, and the <code>Open</code> event which is fired when the calendar is opened.<p>
