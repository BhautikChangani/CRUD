    <p>The <a href="https://www.telerik.com/aspnet-mvc/dateinput" target="_blank">Telerik UI for ASP.NET MVC DateInput component</a> supports the Floating Label featureâ€”a placeholder text for form or input fields, which floats above that field and remains.</p>
    <p>The beneficial thing is that with the Telerik UI for ASP.NET MVC you get the DateInput Floating Label as a built-in feature on the fly as it is really intricate to implement it correctly for all browsers and devices.</p>
    <p>This demo shows how to set both the floating label and its content in the DateInput through the <code>.Label()</code> configuration option. </p>
