<h2 class="kd-title">Description</h2>
<p>
  The <a href="https://www.telerik.com/aspnet-mvc/grid">Telerik UI for ASP.NET MVC Grid</a> comes with an endless scrolling functionality, which enables you to display large amounts of data by appending additional pages of data on demand. The loading of new items is executed when the scrollbar of the Data Grid reaches its end. When the data is returned, only the new items will be rendered and appended to the old ones.
</p>
<p>
  The infinite scrolling of the Data Grid works both with local and with remote data. 
</p>
<p>
  This demo shows how to bind the Grid component to remote data. In this scenario, only the first page of data is serialized and rendered on the client. When the user reaches the end of the list, an AJAX request is made to fetch the next portion of data.
</p>
<p>
  The endless scrolling feature of the Data Grid is compatible with the grouping, hierarchy, and editing functonalities of the component.
