<p>
  The <a href="https://www.telerik.com/aspnet-mvc/grid">Telerik UI for ASP.NET MVC Grid</a> supports the frozen (locked) column feature. Frozen columns are the columns that are visible at all times while the user scrolls the Data Grid horizontally. In this way, the frozen columns functionality enables the Data Grid to display a large number of columns on limited screen space by statically rendering these columns. The concept of frozen columns is well known from MS Excel and many users expect the feature to be available in web environments too.

  The Telerik UI for ASP.NET MVC Grid enables you to implement the frozen column feature by setting a single configuration. This demo shows how to achieve the desired scenario by setting the <code>.Locked(true)</code> Boolean setting of the corresponding column. As a result, the columns in the locked-column group will be rendered to the left of the Grid. In the example, the <strong>Order ID</strong> and <strong>Ship Name</strong> are locked, while the rest of the columns can be scrolled horizontally.
