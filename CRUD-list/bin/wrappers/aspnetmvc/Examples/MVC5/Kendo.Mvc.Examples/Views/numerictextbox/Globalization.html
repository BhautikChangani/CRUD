  <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.telerik.com/aspnet-mvc/globalization/overview">Telerik UI for ASP.NET MVC provides globalization features</a> through the supported internationalization and localization approaches. The internationalization feature applies the desired cultures by providing services for defining these cultures. The Telerik UI for ASP.NET MVC localization services include the available <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.telerik.com/aspnet-mvc/globalization/right-to-left-support">RTL mode of Telerik UI for ASP.NET MVC components</a> and the ability to <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.telerik.com/aspnet-mvc/globalization/localization">change their displayed messages</a> by adding an additional script file in the document.

  This demo showcases the Globalization feature of the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.telerik.com/aspnet-mvc/numerictextbox">Telerik UI for ASP.NET MVC NumericTextBox</a>. The culture and the number formats as well as other culture-specific properties will automatically be adapted.</p>
