<h2 class="kd-title">Description</h2>
<p>Right-to-Left (RTL) support represents the ability of a library, website, or application to handle and respond to users who communicate through right-to-left languages. Right-to-left languages are Arabic, Hebrew, Chinese, Japanese, and others.</p>
<p>The default language input for web users can be left-to-right or right-to-left. The <a href="https://docs.telerik.com/aspnet-mvc/html-helpers/editors/editor/overview" target="_blank">Telerik UI for ASP.NET MVC Editor</a> supports both input modes enabling you to properly render a spectrum of languages, including Hebrew, Chinese, and Arabic, thus making your app a truly global one and helping your localization efforts.</p>
<p>The Telerik UI for ASP.NET MVC Editor component comes with built-in right-to-left (RTL) support and offers right-to-left rendering.</p>
<p>This demo shows how to register the <code>kendo.rtl.min.css</code> file located in the <code>Kendo.Mvc.Examples\Content\web installation</code> folder, and wrap the Editor in a container element with <code>k-rtl </code>class set for it.</p>
