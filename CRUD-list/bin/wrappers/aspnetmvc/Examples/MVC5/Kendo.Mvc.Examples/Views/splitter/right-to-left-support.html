    <p>Right-to-Left (RTL) support represents the ability of a library, website, or application to handle and respond to users who communicate through right-to-left languages. Right-to-left languages are Arabic, Hebrew, Chinese, Japanese, and others.</p>
    <p>The default language input for web users can be left-to-right or right-to-left. The Telerik UI for ASP.NET MVC Splitter supports both input modes enabling you to properly render a spectrum of languages, including Hebrew, Chinese, and Arabic, thus making your app a truly global one and helping your localization efforts.</p>
    <p>The Telerik UI for ASP.NET MVC Splitter component comes with built-in right-to-left (RTL) support and offers right-to-left rendering.</p> 
    <p>This demo shows how to implement the RTL support for the Splitter component.</p>
