  The ASP.NET MVC Data Grid allows you to load and propagate its data by configuring a custom data source, if required, or by using any of the following built-in data-binding options:
<ul>
    <li>View-Model binding (or local binding) for rendering local data in the component.</li>
    <li>AJAX binding by setting a model type and performing AJAX requests to retrieve or update the data.</li>
    <li>ASP.NET Web API through parameter binding which allows you to customize the binding process.</li>
    <li>ASP.NET MVC SignalR for adding real-time functionality (push updates) to the component.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  This demo shows how to configure the ASP.NET MVC Data Grid to display its data and also perform the sorting, paging, and grouping data operations by utilizing the built-in settings of the component.
