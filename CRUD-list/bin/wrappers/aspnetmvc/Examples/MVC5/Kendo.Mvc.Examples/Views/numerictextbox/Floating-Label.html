<h2 class="kd-title">Description</h2>
<p>
  The <a target="_blank" href="https://www.telerik.com/aspnet-mvc/numerictextbox">Telerik UI for ASP.NET MVC NumericTextBox component</a> supports the floating label featureâ€”a label that will move above the input when it is focused.
</p>
<p>
  The benefit is that with the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.telerik.com/aspnet-mvc">Telerik UI for ASP.NET MVC</a>, you get the NumericTextBox floating label as a built-in feature as it is really intricate to implement it correctly for all browsers and devices.
</p>
<p>
  This demo shows how to set both the floating label and its content in the MultiSelect through the <code>.Label()</code> configuration option.
