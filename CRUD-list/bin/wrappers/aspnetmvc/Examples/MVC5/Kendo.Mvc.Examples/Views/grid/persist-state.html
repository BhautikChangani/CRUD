  A common scenario is to save the customization and settings made by users while interacting with your app and, then, restore them
  once they log back at some point in the future.
</p>
<p>
  The <a href="https://www.telerik.com/aspnet-mvc/grid">Telerik UI for ASP.NET MVC Grid</a> enables you to save and restore changes that were previously applied to
  its settings by using its <code><a href="https://docs.telerik.com/kendo-ui/api/javascript/ui/grid/methods/getoptions" target="_blank">getOptions()</a></code> and
  <code><a href="https://docs.telerik.com/kendo-ui/api/javascript/ui/grid/methods/setoptions" target="_blank">setOptions()</a></code>
  client-side methods. You can use these methods to store settings like grouping, paging, sorting, and filtering, and when needed, to restore them. This demo shows how to implement this functionality by using the <code>localStorage</code> key/value pair to save
  and load the state of the Data Grid.
