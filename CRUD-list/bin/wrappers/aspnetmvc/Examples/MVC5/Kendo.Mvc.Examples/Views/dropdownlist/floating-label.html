    <p>The <a href="https://www.telerik.com/aspnet-mvc/dropdownlist" target="_blank">Telerik UI for ASP.NET MVC DropDownList component</a> supports the Floating Label featureâ€”a placeholder text for form or input fields, which floats above that field and remains.</p>
    <p>The great thing is that with the Telerik UI for ASP.NET MVC you get the DropDownList Floating Label as a built-in feature as it is really tricky to implement it correctly for all devices and browsers.</p>
    <p>This demo shows how to set both the floating label and its content in the DropDownList through the <code>.Label()</code> configuration option. </p>
