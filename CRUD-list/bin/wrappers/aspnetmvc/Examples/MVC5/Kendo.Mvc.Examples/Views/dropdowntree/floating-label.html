    <p>The <a href="https://www.telerik.com/aspnet-mvc/dropdowntree" target="_blank">Telerik UI for ASP.NET MVC DropDownTree component</a> supports the floating label featureâ€”a label that will move above the input when it is focused.</p>
    <p>The beneficial thing with the Telerik UI for ASP.NET MVC is that you get the floating label of the DropDownTree as a built-in feature as it is really intricate to implement it correctly for all browsers and devices.</p>
    <p>This demo shows how to set both the floating label and its content in the DropDownTree through the <code>.Label()</code> configuration option.</p>
