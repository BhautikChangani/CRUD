<h2 class="kd-title">Description</h2>
<p>
  The <a href="https://www.telerik.com/aspnet-mvc/grid" target="_blank">Telerik UI for ASP.NET MVC Data Grid</a> enables you to bypass the built-in data processing and handle operations such paging, sorting, filtering, and grouping yourself.
</p>
<p>
  This demo shows how to retrieve a custom response in the Data Grid when the use of the server-side extensions is not desired. The requests are sent in the expected format by the controller but the response is processed programmatically and the custom result data set is passed to the Telerik UI for ASP.NET MVC Grid component.
