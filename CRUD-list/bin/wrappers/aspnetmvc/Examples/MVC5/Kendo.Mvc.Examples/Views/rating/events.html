    <p>The <a href="https://www.telerik.com/aspnet-mvc/rating" target="_blank">Telerik ASP.NET MVC Rating component</a> supports a set of events which enable you to intercept and provide a fluent experience while ensuring smooth interaction with the component. All events are handled in the <strong>Console Log</strong> when you interact with the component.</p>
    <p>This demo example shows how to handle the <code>Change</code> event that fires once the value of the Rating is changed through user interaction and the <code>Select</code> event which fires when an item is selected in the Rating, again through user interaction.</p>
