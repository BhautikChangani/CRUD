    <p>Globalization is a process which combines web applications adaptation to meet the requirements of local markets and different languages (localization) with their adaptation to specific cultures (internationalization).</p>
    <p>The <a href="https://docs.telerik.com/aspnet-mvc/html-helpers/editors/maskedtextbox/globalization/overview" target="_blank">MaskedTextBox supports globalization</a> and allows you to change the culture in the currency symbol and in the decimal point currency delimiter, as demonstrated is this demo.</p>
    <p><a href="https://docs.telerik.com/aspnet-mvc/globalization/overview" target="_blank">Telerik UI for ASP.NET MVC</a> provides globalization features through the supported internationalization and localization approaches. The internationalization feature applies the desired cultures by providing services for defining these cultures, and parsing and formatting dates and numbers. The Telerik UI for ASP.NET MVC localization services include the available <a href="https://docs.telerik.com/aspnet-mvc/globalization/right-to-left-support" target="_blank">RTL mode of Telerik UI for ASP.NET MVC components</a> and the ability to <a href="https://docs.telerik.com/aspnet-mvc/globalization/localization" target="_blank">change their displayed messages</a> by adding an additional script file in the document.</p>
