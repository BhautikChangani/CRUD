  The <a href="https://www.telerik.com/aspnet-mvc/datepicker">Telerik UI for ASP.NET MVC DatePicker</a> offers various options which allow you to control its appearance. You can also easily switch between the available <a href="https://docs.telerik.com/aspnet-mvc/styles-and-layout/sass-themes/overview" target="_blank">themes</a> and <a href="https://docs.telerik.com/aspnet-mvc/styles-and-layout/sass-themes/swatches" target="_blank">swatches</a>. When you are satisfied with the result, it is easy to check and even copy the source code of the DatePicker.

  The styling options showcased in this demo support only the default values when using the LESS themes. You can find more information about this topic in the <a href="https://docs.telerik.com/aspnet-mvc/styles-and-layout/less-themes/less-themes-migration" target="_blank">LESS Themes Migration article</a>. As the introduction of the styling options is an ongoing effort, there may be minor changes and touch-ups added to the options in the future.

  The R1 2022 release introduces new rendering for several components. In the long run, the team will make similar rendering improvements to most of the UI components in the suite. <a href="https://docs.telerik.com/aspnet-mvc/styles-and-layout/components-rendering-overview" target="_blank">These are breaking changes that affect both the SASS and the LESS-based themes</a>.
