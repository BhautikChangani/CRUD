    <p>The <a href="https://www.telerik.com/aspnet-mvc/autocomplete" target="_blank">Telerik UI for ASP.NET MVC AutoComplete component</a> supports the Floating Label featureâ€”a label that will move above the input when it is focused.</p>
    <p>With the Telerik UI for ASP.NET MVC you get the AutoComplete Floating Label as a built-in feature to use on the fly as it is really tricky to implement it correctly for all browsers and devices.</p>
    <p>This demo shows how to set both the floating label and its content in the AutoComplete through the <code>.Label()</code> configuration option.</p>
