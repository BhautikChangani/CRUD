        Like all Gantt charts, the <a href="https://www.telerik.com/aspnet-mvc/ganttchart" target="_blank">Telerik UI for ASP.NET MVC Gantt</a> is commonly used in project management and provides a way of showing tasks or events displayed against time. On the left of the chart is a list of the activities and along the top is a time scale. Each activity is represented by a bar; the position and length of the bar reflects the start date, duration, and end date of the activity. This layout enables users to distinguish at a glance:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>What the various activities are.</li>
        <li>When each activity begins and ends.</li>
        <li>For how long each activity is scheduled to last.</li>
        <li>Where activities overlap with other activities, and by how much.</li>
        <li>The time duration of the whole project.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The <a href="https://www.telerik.com/aspnet-mvc/ganttchart" target="_blank">Telerik UI for ASP.NET MVC Gantt</a> implementation consists of a TreeList section where the user can edit the tasks, sort, and reorder them in a grid-like fashion, and a Timeline section where the tasks and dependencies are visualized under an adjustable time ruler. The user can resize, move, edit, and remove the bars of the tasks in the chart. The Gantt also supports the display of the Timeline section in the day, week, and month views.</p>
    <p>The current example displays a common configuration of the Gantt component.</p>
    <p>The ASP.NET MVC Gantt control is part of <a href="https://www.telerik.com/aspnet-mvc" target="_blank">Telerik UI for ASP.NET MVC</a>, a professional-grade UI library with 110+ components for building modern and feature-rich web applications. The Gantt is a server-side wrapper for the <a href="https://docs.telerik.com/kendo-ui/controls/gantt/overview" target="_blank">Kendo UI for jQuery Gantt</a> component and comes in the form an HtmlHelper.</p>
