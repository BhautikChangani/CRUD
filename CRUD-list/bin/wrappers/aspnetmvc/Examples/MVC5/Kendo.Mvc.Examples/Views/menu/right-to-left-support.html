<h2 class="kd-title">Description</h2>
<p>
    Right-to-Left (RTL) support represents the ability of a library, website, or application to handle and respond to users who communicate through right-to-left languages. Right-to-left languages are Arabic, Hebrew, Chinese, Japanese, and others. 
</p>
<p>
    The default language input for web users can be left-to-right or right-to-left. The <a target="_blank" href="https://www.telerik.com/aspnet-mvc/menu">Telerik UI for ASP.NET MVC Menu</a> supports both input modes enabling you to properly render a spectrum of languages, including Hebrew, Chinese, and Arabic, thus making your app a truly global one and helping your localization efforts.
</p>
<p>
    This <a target="_blank" href="https://www.telerik.com/aspnet-mvc/menu">Telerik UI for ASP.NET MVC Menu</a> demo shows how to initialize the RTL feature by adding <code>k-rtl</code> to the <code>div</code> class, and renders the data of the Menu component according to the right-to-left standards used by the languanges that are written and read from right to left.
