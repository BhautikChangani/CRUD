<h2 class="kd-title">Description</h2>
<p>
  The ForeignKey column functionality of the <a href="https://www.telerik.com/aspnet-mvc/grid">Telerik UI for ASP.NET MVC Grid</a> component is primarily used for matching the value of a bound property to a desired text field from a collection that is external for the Data Grid. The ForeignKey column approach follows the convention of the SQL ForeignKey functionality that is used for linking two tables based on a foreign key.
</p>
<p>
  This demo shows how to implement a foreign key column which fetches its values from a DataSource in the ASP.NET MVC Data Grid which hosts the <a href="https://www.telerik.com/aspnet-mvc/dropdownlist">Telerik UI for ASP.NET MVC DropDownList</a> component as an editor for modifying the data.
