    <p>The <a href="https://www.telerik.com/aspnet-mvc/listview" target="_blank">Telerik UI for ASP.NET MVC ListView</a> endless scrolling functionality allows you to optimize the performance of substantial amounts of data by appending additional records on demand and displaying only a subset of items. Whenever the scrollbar of the list view reaches its end, new items are loaded.</p>
    <p>This demo is a runnable example of the endless scrolling functionality. You can enable the endless scroll mode of the ListView by setting the Scrollable property to .Scrollable(ListViewScrollableMode.Endless)..</p>
