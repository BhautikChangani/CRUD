  OData (Open Data Protocol) is an ISO/IEC approved, OASIS standard that defines a set of best practices for building
  and consuming REST APIs. The protocol enables the creation of REST-based services which allow resources which are 
  identified by using Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) and defined in a data model to be published and edited by 
  Web clients using simple HTTP messages.

  The <a href="https://www.telerik.com/aspnet-mvc/grid">Telerik UI for ASP.NET MVC Grid</a> enables you to 
  bind it to an oData service, as demonstrated by this example. To implement the binding approach, specify
  <code>.Type("odata")</code> so that the requests can be sent to the oData endpoint in the expected format and out of the
  box.
