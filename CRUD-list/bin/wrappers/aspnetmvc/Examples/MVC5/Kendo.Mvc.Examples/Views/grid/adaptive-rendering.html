<h2 class="kd-title">Description</h2>
<p>
  The <a href="https://www.telerik.com/aspnet-mvc/grid" target="_blank">Telerik UI for ASP.NET MVC Grid</a> supports the adaptive mobile rendering feature, which you can enable by setting its <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.telerik.com/aspnet-mvc/api/kendo.mvc.ui.fluent/gridbuilder#mobile"><code>Mobile</code></a> attribute to <code>true</code>. As a result, the Grid will display the column and filter menu, and the popup edit form slider in a new screen for the user. You can force the mobile rendering for all browser types by setting the <code>mobile</code> configuration to <code>phone</code>.
</p>
<p>
  The column resizing feature on touch-screen devices is triggered when the user taps and holds the respective column header. When the <strong>Resize</strong> icon appears, the user can resize the column by dragging.
