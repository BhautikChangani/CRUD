<h2 class="kd-title">Description</h2>
<p>
  Right-to-Left (RTL) support represents the ability of a library, website, or application to handle and respond to users who communicate through right-to-left languages. Right-to-left languages are Arabic, Hebrew, Chinese, Japanese, and others. 
</p>
<p>
  The default language input for web users can be left-to-right or right-to-left. The Telerik UI for ASP.NET MVC Grid supports both input modes enabling you to properly render a spectrum of languages, including Hebrew, Chinese, and Arabic, thus making your app a truly global one and helping your localization efforts.
</p>
<p>
  Right out of the box, the <a href="https://www.telerik.com/aspnet-mvc/grid">Telerik UI for ASP.NET MVC Grid</a> provides RTL support for languages where users read
  starting from right to left such as Arabic or Hebrew. This mode of the Data Grid allows for the columns to be reversed and the rightmost column to become first.
</p>
<p>
  The <a href="https://www.telerik.com/aspnet-mvc/grid">Telerik UI for ASP.NET MVC Grid</a> supports right-to-left languages and rendering. To implement the RTL support for the component, register the <code>kendo.rtl.min.css</code> file, which is located in the <code>Kendo.Mvc.Examples\\Content\\web\\ installation</code> folder, and wrap the Data Grid in a container element with the <code>k-rtl</code> class set for it, as
  demonstrated in this example.
