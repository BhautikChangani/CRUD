      The <a href="https://www.telerik.com/aspnet-mvc/scheduler" target="_blank">Telerik UI for ASP.NET MVC Scheduler</a> provides the vertical virtualization feature, which optimizes the rendering of the view by doing a DOM virtualization. The vertical virtualization functionality is available for the Day, Week, WorkWeek, and Month views.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can enable vertical virtualization by using the <code>Virtual(true)</code> method in the view configuration in the following way: <code>views.WeekView(view => view.Selected(true).Virtual(true));</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
        When the feature is enabled, the view will render additional DOM elements as you scroll down.
