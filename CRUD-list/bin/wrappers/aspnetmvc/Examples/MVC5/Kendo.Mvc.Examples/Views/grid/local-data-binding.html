<p>
  The <a href="https://www.telerik.com/aspnet-mvc/grid">Telerik UI for ASP.NET MVC Grid</a> offers the following generic ways of data-binding:
</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li><a href="https://docs.telerik.com/aspnet-mvc/html-helpers/data-management/grid/binding/ajax-binding" target="_blank">Ajax binding</a>&#8212;The Data Grid component performs server-side requests when doing paging, sorting, and filtering. 
    In this mode, the Grid retrieves only the data representing the current page in JSON format. 
    As a result, only the component is updated.</li>
    <li>Client operations&#8212;You can perform all Data Grid data operations on the client or pass the model
    through the view by setting the <code>ServerOperations(false)</code> of the DataSource.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  This demo shows how to bind the Data Grid for ASP.NET MVC through a model that is passed by the View, and perform all
  data operations on the client side.
